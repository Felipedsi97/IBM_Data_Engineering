# Simple ETL Pipeline

This project demonstrates a basic **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process in Python.

- **Extract**: Reads data from CSV, JSON, and XML files.  
- **Transform**: Converts height (inches → meters) and weight (pounds → kilograms).  
- **Load**: Saves the transformed data into `transformed_data.csv`.  
- **Logging**: Tracks progress in `log_file.txt` with timestamps.  

Run the script to process all files in the directory and generate clean, standardized output.
